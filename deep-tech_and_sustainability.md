# Deep-Tech and Sustainability<br>---<br>A Look Forward

# Agenda

## Ask open ended questions about tech and ethics

## Warning - No 'Right' Answers!

# About Me

# About Us

# BIV is a an early-stage deep-tech VC
- Pre seed investments through incubation
- Seed investment

## What's deep-tech anyway?

# For Us This Means
- AI
- Machine Learning
- Blockchain
- Big Data
- Etc.

## We make investments for profit

## Can we do good?

## What's 'Good' under Venture Capitalism?

## What's 'Good' under ~~Venture~~ Capitalism?

# Food For Thought

## Tech For Good

# _"To know the Good is to do the Good"_<br>(Socrates)
- Do we know enough to know Good from Bad?
- Do we have enough information?
- Climate Change in face of alternative facts?

## What is 'Good'?

## OK, let's try something simpler

## Tech and Sustainability

## What is Sustainability?

## for Economies

## for Resources

# Are we promoting
- Good for the planet
- Using a Global mindset

## for Societies

# Should we promote Societies with
  - Less inequality?
  - Better social mobility?

## Here comes the talk about UBI...

## Wait, let's get back to inequality in a minute, but...

## What kind of tech is this relevant for?

## Can we do CRM for Good?

## What Tech has ethical implications?

## Let's consider Infrastructure

## _'Changing the fabric of societies & economies'_

## Is infrastructure Good or Bad?

## Infrastructure can have unintended effects

# Infrastructure Examples
- the Printing Press (The dawn of the information age?)
- The Stock Exchange
- Combustion engines and Cars
- Fission reactors and the atom bombs
- the Internet
- Blockchain

## And getting back to inequality

## Is Inequality Good or Bad?

# Thought Experiment
_A world with more inequality, where the 'long tail' is raised above the poverty line. So no one is poor anymore, while the rich basically become a race of super mutant enhanced cyborgs ruling through untold fortune._

# Paul Graham, <br> Y-Combinator
> _“I’ve become an expert on how to increase economic inequality ... You can’t prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people from getting rich, and you can’t do that without preventing them from starting startups.”_

## Is this Sustainable?

## Maybe that's just Silicon Valley Mentality

## Is Berlin Different?

# Berlin
- Political climate and stability
- Economical background
  - Large SMB sector mindset
- Strong privacy mentality
- Clear, well defined Governmental institutions
- International, diverse culturally

# Let's talk about different economic frameworks

# For Profit vs. Nonprofit

## Is profit Bad?
## Is nonprofit Good?

# Test Cases

# Nonprofit in the Public Sector

## Governments
## UN

# Nonprofit in the Private Sector

# Bill and Melinda Gates
- ~$4B yearly into
  - Development
    - Agriculture, Nutrition, Hygiene and more
  - Health
    - Vaccines, Malaria, HIV, Tuberculosis and more.
  - Education
  - Etc.

# For-profit in the Private Sector

# Examples
- Edison
- Ford
- Jobs
  - Personal Computing and iPhones
  - The iCar...?
- Musk
  - Renewable Energy, Electric Cars, Batteries

# The Case for Private Sector National Infrastructure
- Transportation
- Smart Grids
- Decentralized Markets
- Democratization of the Corporate

# Closing remarks

## Should we expect tech to facilitate better human societies?

## Can power hungry a-holes do good?

##  Accidentally?

## _'Sheep with Nuclear Weapons'_<br>(Noah Harari)

## Are we accountable for our place in the living realm

# Thank You

# Check My Tech
- Does it aim to be transformative or disruptive?
- Does it reduce inequality?
- Is it meant to be widely available, accessible?
- Is it sustainable
  - For communities?
  - For resources
- Is it accountable

# Really, Thank You

# Github

# Create a community that's different because we want to start from inspiration

# Sustainability is a way of thinking

# Sustainability is about plasticity in the brain to interact with other domains



## Notes

- give just one question

- give a bunch of case examples / studies

- be very clear on how these examples are complicated (trivial or not) or simple for the question you raised
    - Thiel
  - Something Or sent about a journalist interviewing libretarians pushing for more inequality, however keeping a leveraged long tail so to speak. The poor being actually above the poverty line. While the rich basically becoming a race of super mutant enhanced cyborgs ruling through untold fortune.
  - Quantification of humans = good or bad?
  - Inequality for humans = good or bad?
- finally in the summary say the other things you'd want to speak about in a longer talk, very very briefly. this way you make sure you're understood first and that the theme and techniques and approach is understood, before you outline your whole spiel.

- make the core question very very clear and focused. so in your case your'e focusing particularly on infrastructure, where ethical questions beome non-obvious. on large-scale macro-economic questions/changes/effects. on the issue of for-profit=bad, not for profit = good (the prevailing intuition, which breaks down on infrastructural questions).
